Hi, this is jeongwon.
Let me give you the instruction of testing my feedback_system ver.1.

step 0: Please make sure that "datasets/choi/audio" and "datasets/choi/choi-recognition-All.txt" is empty and there is no copy .txt file in "feedback"

step 1: python feedback_import.py
step 2: python monitor_score.py
step 3: python /feedback/test.py

step 4: Check out if the dialogs of LeBlanc, Senna and Ashe have been written on "datasets/choi/choi-recognition-All.txt"!


plus: You can use "feedback/clear.sh" and "datasets/choi/audio/move_back.sh" for easy retry.


If you have any good ideas to fix some possible bugs, please let me know.
Thank you!
